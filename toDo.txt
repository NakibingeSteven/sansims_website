Based on your Sansims project, here's the corrected 3-page Flask website structure:

PAGE 1: HOME (The Impact Story)
Hero Section
Headline: "Programming Education Without Internet. Without New Computers."
Sub-headline: "A 5,000 UGX Sansim device bringing AI, simulations, and Luganda programming to millions of African students using second-hand smartphones"
Visual: Minimalist illustration of Sansim device + second-hand phone
CTA buttons: "See The Solution" | "View Technology"

The Problem (Clean stats)
85% of Ugandan schools lack computer labs
New computers cost 1.5M+ UGX - impossible for most schools
Internet access remains a luxury
Programming taught theoretically only

The Economic Reality (Side-by-side comparison)
Traditional Lab: 40M+ UGX (25 computers + infrastructure + internet)
Sansim Solution: 2.5M UGX (1 Sansim + 30 second-hand phones)
Savings: 94% cost reduction

Our Mission
"Democratizing advanced programming education for millions of African students previously excluded by infrastructure and cost limitations. We turn second-hand smartphones into powerful learning computers."

Quick Stats (3 bold numbers)
5,000 UGX per device
3+ years content development
Millions of potential students

PAGE 2: THE SOLUTION (What We Built)
Header: "Three Years of Development. One Complete Solution."

Section 1: The Sansim Device
ESP32-based offline server
Creates local WiFi network
No internet required
Custom PCB design (December 2024)
Tested and proven on ESP32 development boards

Section 2: Second-Hand Smartphones = Computers
Why smartphones? (50,000-150,000 UGX vs 1.5M+ laptops)
Works with any Android phone
Students can bring their own devices
Families already have these phones

Section 3: Three Pillars of Content
1. AI Educational Apps
TensorFlow.js in-browser training
Students train ML models visually
Learn mathematical functions through AI
Graphical approach to teaching AI concepts
Developed in 2023

2. Luganda Programming Language (Sanlag)
Native language coding environment
Custom Luganda programming keyboards
Bloka visual programming in Luganda
Bloka English version for comparison
Flask-based implementation

3. Interactive Educational Simulations
Physics simulations
Math simulations
Chemistry simulations
Inspired by PhET, 100% original code
2+ years development
HTML5-based educational tools

How It Works (Simple flow diagram)
School purchases Sansim device (5,000 UGX)
Students connect second-hand phones via WiFi
Access all content offline through browser
Learn programming, AI, and STEM subjects

Content Development Timeline
Foundation: Basic server functionality and HTML educational content
2+ years: Educational simulations development
